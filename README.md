# Project Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to write and refactor VBA code that effeciently outputted the "Total Daily Volume" and "Return" for 12 different stocks for the year of 2017 and 2018.  The code is interactive and able to analyze either year, depending on the user's input.  The modules specifically focused on writing code that analyzed stocks with the use of nested loops, conditional if statements, and interactive macro buttons.  The challenge specifically focused on refactoring inefficent code by reusing code and logic learned from the modules.  

# Results 
This section will compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018 and discuss the execution times of the orinigal script and the refactored script.
