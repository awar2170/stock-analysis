# Project Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to write and refactor VBA code that effeciently outputted the "Total Daily Volume" and "Return" for 12 different stocks for the year of 2017 and 2018 to optimize the run time.  The code is interactive and able to analyze either year, depending on the user's input.  The modules specifically focused on writing code that analyzed stocks with the use of nested loops, conditional if statements, and interactive macro buttons.  The challenge specifically focused on refactoring inefficent code by reusing code and logic learned from the modules.  

# Results 
This section will compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018 and discuss the execution times of the orignal script and the refactored script. 

## Stock Years Analysis 
The 2017 stocks have a maximum total daily volume of $782,187,000 from SPWR's stock, a minimum total daily volume of $35,796,200 from DQ's stock, a maximum return of 199.4% from DQ's stock, and a minimum return of -7.2% from TERP's stock.  The 2017 stock has average total daily volume of $263,886,592 and an average return rate of 67.3%. 

The 2018 stocks have a a maximum total daily volume of $607,473,500 from ENPH's stock, a minimum total daily volume of $83,079,900 from AY's stock, a maximum return of 84.0% from DQ's stock, and a minimum return of -62.6% from TERP's stock.  The 2018 stock has an average total daily volume of $275,503,183 and an average return rate of -8.5%.

2017 is the more profitable year, despite having a lower average total daily value, because the year has a positive average return rate.  This means that, on average, the portfolio made money that year. 

## Macro Runtime Analysis
In the orignal script, the 2017 stocks analysis macro had an 0.828125 second run time and the 2018 stocks analysis macro had and 0.84375 runtime.  In the refactored code, the 2017 stocks analysis macro had an 0.828125 second run time and the 2018 stocks analysis macro had and 0.84375 runtime.
